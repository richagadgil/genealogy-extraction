       "'Christina @Q2870961@ Löwenhielm née von Fersen (10 March 1754 – 8 April 1846), was a Swedish countess and courtier. She is known for her love affair with the later @Q52928@. She is also famous in history as one of \"the three graces\" of the Gustavian age; three ladies-in-waiting (@Q2870961@, @Q3052757@ and Louise Meijerfeldt) immortalized in the poem Gracernas döpelse by Johan Henric Kellgren, and known profiles of the epoch.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life ===\\n@Q2870961@ was one of six daughters of the royal Crown Forester count @Q1069154@ Reinhold von Fersen and the lady-in-waiting @Q4979787@.\\nShe was as such also the niece of Axel von Fersen the Elder, a leading force within the Caps, and the cousin of the famous Count Axel von Fersen the Younger. \\nHer father was described as \"one of the most elegant and spirited gentlemen of his time\", and her mother was celebrated for her beauty at the French royal court of Versailles, when she accompanied her aunt and uncle by marriage, @Q3052757@ Tessin and the Swedish ambassador to France count @Q1069154@ @Q3439851@ Tessin, to France.\\nBoth her parents spent their life in service at the royal Swedish court, and @Q2870961@, as well as her sisters, served as hovfröken (maid of honour) prior to her marriage. In December 1770, she married count @Q16649829@ (1743-1810). After their wedding, the couple settled in the country estate of her spouse for a while. They had one son.\\n\\n\\n=== Love affair with Duke @Q52928@ ===\\nDuring the 1771 winter social season in Stockholm, @Q2870961@ Löwenhielm was courted by prince @Q52928@, who had recently returned to Sweden after having been sent abroad to separate him from Brita Horn. Prince @Q52928@ reportedly fell in love with her, she eventually reciprocated, and the relationship that followed has been described as \"the most serious and tender in his [@Q52928@\\'] erotic chronicle\". The couple had a son, @Q1069154@ Axel Löwenhielm. The relationship was well known as accepted, but she was not an official royal mistress; the relationship was rather treated as equal to the other extramarital love affairs which was at that time accepted in the circles of the nobility and royal court.\\nIn 1774, king Gustav III convinced his brother duke @Q52928@ to agree to a dynastic marriage with Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp. The purpose of the marriage was to produce an heir to the throne, because the marriage of the king to Sophia Magdalena of Denmark was unconsummated and childless. On 6 April 1774, the spouse of @Q2870961@ Löwenhielm was appointed Swedish envoy to Dresden and departed for Saxony. @Q2870961@ Löwenhielm remained in Sweden until she was explicitly ordered by the monarch to join her spouse in Dresden prior to the wedding of @Q52928@. She remained in Dresden during the wedding of @Q52928@ in July and the arrival of his bride Charlotte in Sweden, but she kept in contact with @Q52928@ through secret correspondence.\\n@Q2870961@ Löwenhielm was allowed to return to Sweden after the strange affair of the pregnancy of duchess Charlotte. In the end of July 1775, an official proclamation was made stating that duchess Charlotte was pregnant. Charlotte, who initially denied being pregnant, soon herself claimed to have felt the fetus move. However, no signs of pregnancy was visible. On 14 September, Charlotte was examined again, and this time, the pregnancy was announced to have been surely assured. The date of the expected birth was given as 24 October, and preparations was made for the official customary rituals association with a royal birth. However, on 24 October, all preparations was suddenly cancelled without explanation.    \\nIt is unknown whether the whole affair was a deliberate deceit and, in that case, who was responsible, and why. At the time, there was a rumor that it was in fact the king who had invented the pregnancy. The reason was that he had decided to consummate his own marriage and provide and heir to the throne by himself rather than to leave this task to his brother, and that he wished to make duchess Charlotte sexually unavailable and direct the sexual interest of his brother elsewhere to avoid any legitimate offspring of @Q52928@. Adolf Ludvig Hamilton describes this rumor: \"The king feared all influence of duke @Q52928@ upon the throne, also as the father of an heir to the throne. He found the affection between him and his young consort to be to great. The condition in question separated the prince from her, accustomed him to others, a habit he has since then never abandoned, and the purpose being achieved the monarch saw that the ridicule would affect no one but the spouses. All this was successful.\" \\nDuring the summer of 1775, the king himself did consummate his marriage with the assistance of Adolf @Q16649829@ Munck, and duke @Q52928@, who had a temporary affair with countess Hedvig Amalia Lewenhaupt, asked the king for permission for @Q2870961@ Löwenhielm to return to Sweden, which was granted.\\n@Q2870961@ Löwenhielm, who was rumored to have had an affair with @Q52928@ of Saxony, Duke of Courland while in Dresden, returned to Sweden in the autumn of 1776 and officially returned to the royal court, where she was introduced to duchess Charlotte, on 18 November 1776. \\nThe spouse of @Q52928@, Duchess Charlotte, describes the incident in her famous journal: \"She is with no doubt delightful, her facial features are pleasant, her appearance appealing, and dressed for ball, she is quite magnificent, thought perhaps somewhat stout. You should have seen how everyone looked at me, I did therefore attempt to appear indifferent, though I was really very curious.\"  \\nDuke @Q52928@ started to court her as soon as she return, wishing to continue their affair, dividing the court in fractions who tried to encourage or discourage the affair, but @Q2870961@ Löwenhielm initially declined. Instead, she had a brief affair with baron @Q1069154@ Adam Wachtmeister and with the Russian Prince Alexander Kurakin, who had been sent to Sweden by Catherine the Great to officially bring the news of the marriage of the Grand Duke. In December 1776, however, it was clear that the relationship between duke @Q52928@ and @Q2870961@ Löwenhielm been resumed.\\nThe affair between duke @Q52928@ and @Q2870961@ Löwenhielm was discontinued in the summer of 1777. It was ended by Löwenhielm, reportedly because she had fallen in love with baron Hans Henric von Essen. One year later, von Essen had become her official lover, while duke @Q52928@ had entered into his relationship with Charlotte Slottsberg.\\n\\n\\n=== Court life ===\\n\\nFrom 1777 to 1795, @Q2870961@ Löwenhielm served as statsfru (Lady of the Bedchamber) to Queen Sophia Magdalena.\\nAlongside @Q3052757@ and Louise Meijerfeldt, she became known as one of \"the three graces\" in the poem Gracernas döpelse (The Baptism of the Graces) by Johan Henric Kellgren, which was written in circa 1779 and published in 1781.During her stay in Paris, her mother had studied dance under Marie Sallé and in turn instructed her daughters, who became known for their grace and talent within dance in the amateur theatre in the court of Gustav III.\\nThe most talented participators within the famous amateur court theater of Gustav III were Caroline Lewenhaupt, @Q5729159@, Hedvig Ulrika De la Gardie, Nils Barck, Maria Aurora Uggla, Otto Jacob von Manteuffel Zöge, Bror Cederström and the sisters @Q3052757@ and @Q2870961@.@Q2870961@ Löwenhielm became known for her elegance, her good taste and her charm. Duchess Charlotte, the wife of Duke @Q52928@, noted in her famous journal that @Q2870961@ did not have a bad effect on @Q52928@, and that she was a kind person who, due to her tolerant attitude toward others, was also treated tolerantly herself: \"As it happened the other day, Countess Löwenhielm was late at dinner and arrived a quarter of an hour after it had started, and unfortunately, Baron von Essen arrived at the same time. All of us aware of their relationship found it amusing, and some could not hide a smile.\"  @Q3052757@ remarked of the incident: \"To think if something of that sort would happen to another poor soul - they would never hear the end of it. But my sister is always excused, and it can only be seen as proof of her open nature and her frankness to expose her relationship to that meek Essen for the world\". Charlotte then replied: \"She may not be more careful than others, but of a kind and goodhearted nature, she is friendly toward all and does not interfere in other people\\'s business, which makes her less exposed to slander than most\".@Q2870961@ was indirectly involved in a scandalous duel. From 1778 until 1788, she had a permanent relationship with baron Hans Henric von Essen. In 1788, her lover, von Essen, proposed to the heiress @Q4979787@ Eleonora De Geer (1771–1798) and was accepted. His proposal was met with great dislike within the royal court because of sympathy with the popular @Q2870961@, and he was challenged to a duel by his rival count Adolph Ribbing. Ribbing had also proposed to De Geer but had been declined by her father, which he refused to accept, as he believed he had reasons to think that De Geer preferred him and that Essen had proposed because of economic reasons, and because von Essen\\'s proposal and marriage plans was commonly disliked within the court. The duel took place in the royal riding house in the presence of several officers and led to the defeat of von Essen, who was slightly injured. The duel was regarded as a scandal and a crime against the King  The duel affair also caused great Ribbing to feel great animosity against the king, and he was later involved in the regicide against Gustav III.\\nAfter the Riksdag of the Estates of 1789, when Gustav III came in conflict with the nobility, he arrested her uncle Axel von Fersen the Elder as a leader of the aristocratic opposition to the Union and Security Act and the Russo-Swedish War (1788–90), but unlike many other female members of the nobility, she never joined the demonstration of Jeanna von Lantingshausen.\\nIn 1795, her mother, chief lady in waiting to queen Sophia Magdalena although bedridden, was relieved from her position, and her daughters @Q3052757@ and @Q2870961@ simultaneously left their positions at court in solidarity, officially to tend to their mother\\'s health.\\nHer mother died later that same year. In 1799, she presented Lolotte Forssberg at court. Her last years were spent in religion and charity.\\n\\n\\n== Children ==\\n@Q3439851@ (1771–1856)\\n@Q1069154@ (1772–1861), with Duke @Q52928@\\n@Q4979787@ Lovisa Löwenhielm (1774-1783)\\n@Q16649829@ August Löwenhielm (1776-1776)\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20071109181125/http://historiska-personer.nu/min-s/pc399b874.html (Swedish)\\nIngvar Andersson: Gustavianskt (The Gustavian age) (1979)\\nUlf Sundberg (Swedish): Kungliga släktband (Lund 2004)\\nSvensk biografiskt lexikon (Swedish)\\nPersonhistorisk tidskrift, (Första årgången 1898–99) (Swedish)\\n@Q1069154@ Forsstrand (in Swedish): De tre gracerna, minnen och anteckningar från @Q3439851@ III:s Stockholm (\"The three graces, memories and notes from the Stockholm of Gustav III\") Hugo Gebers förlag (1912)\\n@Q1069154@ Rimberg (Swedish) : Svenska Folkets underbara öden VII.

       "'Julia the Elder (30 October 39 BC – AD 14), known to her contemporaries as Julia Caesaris filia or Julia Augusti filia (Classical Latin: IVLIA•CAESARIS•FILIA or IVLIA•AVGVSTI•FILIA), was the daughter of Augustus Caesar, the first Roman Emperor, and his second wife, Scribonia. Julia was also stepsister and second wife of the Emperor Tiberius; maternal grandmother of the Emperor Caligula and the Empress Agrippina the Younger; grandmother-in-law of the Emperor Claudius; and maternal great-grandmother of the Emperor Nero.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life ===\\nAt the time of Julia\\'s birth, 39 BC, Augustus had not yet received the title \"Augustus\" and was known as \"Gaius Julius Caesar Divi Filius,\" though historians refer to him as \"Octavian\" until 27 BC, when Julia was 11. Octavian divorced Julia\\'s mother the day of her birth and took Julia from her soon thereafter. Octavian, in accordance with Roman custom, claimed complete parental control over her. She was sent to live with her stepmother Livia when she was old enough and learn how to be an aristocrat. Her education appears to have been strict and somewhat old-fashioned. Thus, in addition to her studies, Suetonius informs us, she was taught spinning and weaving. Macrobius mentions \"her love of literature and considerable culture, a thing easy to come by in that household\".Julia\\'s social life was severely controlled, and she was allowed to talk only to people whom her father had vetted. However, Octavian had a great affection for his daughter and made sure she had the best teachers available. Macrobius preserves a remark of Augustus: \"There are two wayward daughters that I have to put up with: the Roman commonwealth and Julia.\"In 37 BC, during Julia\\'s early childhood, Octavian\\'s friends Gaius Maecenas and Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa concluded an agreement with Octavian\\'s great rival Mark Antony. It was sealed with an engagement: Antony\\'s ten-year-old son Marcus Antonius Antyllus was to marry Julia, then two years old.\\nThe engagement never led to a marriage because civil war broke out. In 31 BC, at the Battle of Actium, Octavian and Agrippa defeated Antony and his wife, Cleopatra. In Alexandria, they both committed suicide, and Octavian became sole ruler of the Roman Empire.\\n\\n\\n=== First marriage ===\\nAs with most aristocratic Roman women of the period, expectations of Julia focused on marriage and on the resulting family alliances. Moreover, Augustus desired a male issue; as his only living child Julia\\'s duty would be to provide her father with grandsons whom he could adopt as his heirs.In 25 BC, at the age of fourteen, Julia married her first cousin Marcus Claudius Marcellus, the son of her father\\'s sister Octavia, who was some three years older than her. Augustus himself was not present for the wedding as he was fighting a war in Spain and had fallen ill. Instead, he commissioned Agrippa to preside over the ceremony and hold the festival in his absence.The decision to marry Marcellus to Julia, and then Augustus\\'s choice to raise Marcellus to the pontificate and curule aedileship, was perceived to be an indication that he would be Augustus\\' successor in power, despite his youth. This put him at odds with Agrippa, whom people believed would oppose Marcellus\\' accession to power; the apparent preference for Marcellus is allegedly the catalyst that led to Agrippa to withdraw to Mytilene, Greece.However, Marcellus died in September 23 BC when Julia was sixteen. The union produced no children.\\n\\n\\n=== Marriage to Agrippa ===\\n\\nIn 21 BC, having now reached the age of 18, Julia married Agrippa, a man from a modest family who had risen to become Augustus\\' most trusted general and friend. This step is said to have been taken partly on the advice of Maecenas, who in counseling him remarked: \"You have made him so great that he must either become your son-in-law or be slain.\" Since Agrippa was nearly 25 years her elder, it was a typical arranged marriage, with Julia functioning as a pawn in her father\\'s dynastic plans. There is from this period the report of an infidelity with one Sempronius Gracchus, with whom Julia allegedly had a lasting liaison (Tacitus describes him as \"a persistent paramour\"). This was the first of a series of alleged adulteries. According to Suetonius, Julia\\'s marital status did not prevent her from conceiving a passion for Augustus\\' stepson, and thus her stepbrother, Tiberius, so it was widely rumoured.The newlyweds lived in a villa in Rome that has since been excavated near the modern Farnesina in Trastevere. Agrippa and Julia\\'s marriage resulted in five children: Gaius Caesar, Julia the Younger, Lucius Caesar, Agrippina the Elder (mother of Caligula), and Agrippa Postumus (a posthumous son). From June 20 BC to the spring of 18 BC, Agrippa was governor of Gaul, and it is likely that Julia followed him across the Alps. Shortly after their arrival, their first child Gaius was born, and in 19 BC, Julia gave birth to Vipsania Julia. After their return to Italy, a third child followed: a son named Lucius. In 17 BC, Augustus adopted the newborn Lucius and the three-year-old Gaius.  He took care of their education personally. Although Agrippa died in 12 BC, Augustus did not adopt the third brother, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa Posthumus, until AD 4, after the exile of Julia - and after the deaths of both Gaius and Lucius.\\nNicolaus and Josephus mention that during Julia\\'s marriage to Agrippa, she travelled to meet Agrippa where he was campaigning. She was caught up in a flash flood in Ilium (Troy), and almost drowned. Agrippa was furious, and in his anger he fined the locals 100,000 drachmae. The fine was a heavy blow but no one would face Agrippa to request an appeal.  Only after Herod, king of Judaea, went to Agrippa to request a pardon did he withdraw the fine. In the spring of 16 BC, Agrippa and Julia started a tour through the eastern provinces, where they visited Herod. In October 14 BC, the couple traveled to Athens, where Julia gave birth to her fourth child, Agrippina.\\nAfter the winter, the family returned to Italy. Julia quickly became pregnant again, but her husband died suddenly in March 12 BC in Campania at the age of 51. He was buried in the Mausoleum of Augustus. Julia named the posthumous son Marcus in his honor. He was to be known as Agrippa Postumus. Immediately after the boy was born, and while Julia was still in mourning, Augustus had her betrothed and then remarried to Tiberius, her stepbrother.\\n\\n\\n=== Marriage to Tiberius ===\\nAfter the death of Agrippa, Augustus sought to promote his step-son Tiberius, believing that this would best serve his own dynastic interests. Tiberius married Julia (11 BC), but first had to divorce Vipsania Agrippina (daughter from a previous marriage of Agrippa), the woman he dearly loved. Suetonius alleges that Tiberius had a low opinion of Julia\\'s character, while Tacitus claims that she disdained Tiberius as an unequal match and even sent her father a letter, written by Sempronius Gracchus, denouncing him.  The marriage was thus blighted almost from the start, and the son that Julia bore him died in infancy. By 6 BC, when Tiberius departed for Rhodes, if not earlier, the couple had separated.\\n\\n\\n=== Scandal ===\\nBecause Augustus was her legitimate father, having married her mother with conubium, Augustus had Patria Potestas over her. Patria Potestas lasted until the paterfamilias, Augustus, either died or emancipated his child. Marriage had no effect on Patria Potestas, unless it was manus marriage which was rare at this point in time.\\nAs the daughter of Augustus, mother (now legally the sister) of two of his heirs, Lucius and Gaius, and wife of another, Tiberius, Julia\\'s future seemed assured to all. Yet in 2 BC she was arrested for adultery and treason; Augustus sent her a letter in Tiberius\\' name declaring the marriage null and void (Tiberius was at this time on the island of Rhodes and unable to respond quickly). He also asserted in public that she had been plotting against his own life. Though at the time Augustus had been passing legislation to promote family values, he likely knew of her intrigues with other men but hesitated for some time to accuse her. Several of Julia\\'s supposed lovers were exiled, most notably Sempronius Gracchus, while Iullus Antonius (son of Mark Antony and Fulvia) was forced to commit suicide. Others have suggested that Julia\\'s alleged paramours were members of her city clique, who wished to remove Tiberius from favour and replace him with Antonius. This would explain the letter, written by Gracchus, asking Augustus to allow Julia to divorce Tiberius.\\n\\n\\n=== Exile ===\\nReluctant to execute her, Augustus decided instead to confine Julia on Pandateria, an island that measures less than 1.75 square kilometres (0.68 sq mi), with no men in sight and forbidden even to drink wine. Her mother, Scribonia, accompanied her into exile.  She was allowed no visitor unless her father had given permission and had been informed of the stature, complexion, and even of any marks or scars upon his body.In AD 6, Julia\\'s youngest son, Agrippa Postumus, was exiled for his growing unruliness. Then in 8 her elder daughter, Julia the Younger, was exiled to Tremirus also charged with adultery; it may also have been related to the attempted revolt by her husband Lucius Aemilius Paullus and one Plautius Rufus. It is said that at any mention of Julia or her two disgraced children, Augustus would remark of them: \"If only I had never married, or had died childless\", slightly misquoting Hector, in the Iliad.Five years after her initial exile, around AD 4, Julia was moved to Rhegium on the mainland and Augustus appears to have granted her a peculium (property), a yearly income and permitted her to walk about the town. Despite these concessions Augustus never forgave her nor ever allowed her to return to Rome. This choice appears to have been unpopular with the Roman people who petitioned several times for her to be recalled. Julia\\'s exile cast a long shadow over Augustus\\'s remaining years. There is mention of at least one suppressed plot to take her from captivity; one Lucius Audasius and one Asinius Epicadus had planned to forcibly take her and her son Agrippa Postumus from where they were held and to the armies, presumably to stage a coup against Augustus.Upon Augustus\\' death in 14, Tiberius ascended to the Princeps. Despite having shown some sympathy towards Julia when she was initially exiled, he instead enforced harsher conditions upon her. He removed her dowry and yearly income, citing that Augustus had failed to make provisions for them in his will, and thus left her destitute. Furthermore, he denied her permission to leave her house or receive visitors.\\n\\n\\n=== Death and aftermath ===\\nJulia died in 14 AD, some time after Augustus\\' death. While it is generally agreed by contemporary historians that it was as a result of Tiberius\\'s actions against her, the circumstances of her death are obscure. Dio Cassius indicates Tiberius had a direct hand in her death by imprisoning her until she died either from debility or starvation. Tacitus remarks that upon learning Postumus had been murdered, she succumbed to despair and her health slowly declined. Augustus had explicitly given instructions in his will that she should not be buried in his Mausoleum of Augustus.\\nSimultaneously, her alleged paramour Sempronius Gracchus, who had endured 14 years of exile on Cercina (Kerkenna) off the African coast, was executed either at Tiberius\\' instigation or on the independent initiative of Nonius Asprenas, proconsul of Africa.\\nHer daughter Julia died in AD 29 after 20 years of exile; she was also forbidden to be buried in Augustus\\' tomb by his will.\\nAccording to Suetonius, after his own ascension Caligula, the son of Julia\\'s daughter Agrippina and Tiberius\\'s nephew Germanicus, would claim that his mother Agrippina was the product of an incestuous union between Julia and Augustus. The reason for this is allegedly because he did not wish to be thought of as the grandson of Agrippa due to his humble origins. However, the existence of coins and inscriptions dating from Caligula\\'s reign that clearly identify Agrippina as Agrippa\\'s daughter suggests this account is apocryphal.\\n\\n\\n== Cultural depictions ==\\n\\n\\n=== In ancient literature ===\\nAmong contemporary writers Julia is almost universally remembered for her flagrant and promiscuous conduct. Thus Marcus Velleius Paterculus (2.100) describes her as \"tainted by luxury or lust\", listing among her lovers Iullus Antonius, Quintius Crispinus, Appius Claudius, Sempronius Gracchus, and Cornelius Scipio. Seneca the Younger refers to \"adulterers admitted in droves\"; Pliny the Elder calls her an “exemplum licentiae” (NH 21.9). Dio Cassius mentions \"revels and drinking parties by night in the Forum and even upon the Rostra\" (Roman History 55.10). Seneca (De Beneficiis 6.32) tells us that the Rostra was the place where \"her father had proposed a law against adultery\", and yet now she had chosen the place for her \"debaucheries\". Seneca specifically mentions prostitution: \"laying aside the role of adulteress, she there [in the Forum] sold her favours, and sought the right to every indulgence with even an unknown paramour.\" Modern historians discredit these representations as exaggerating Julia\\'s behaviour.Macrobius provides invaluable details of her witticisms and personality. Among the sassy ripostes he attributes to her is a retort to people\\'s surprise that all her children all resembled Agrippa - “I take on a passenger only when the ship’s hold is full.” On her character, he writes that Julia was extensively celebrated for her amiable, empathetic nature and studiousness despite her profligacy: \"[S]he was abusing her standing as fortune’s darling, and her father’s, though in other respects she gained a great deal of credit for her love of literature and extensive learning... and her kindness, fellow-feeling, and lack of cruelty.\"Sidonius Apollinaris, writing in the 5th century, was the first person to identify Julia as the figure Corinna in Ovid\\'s Amores.\\n\\n\\n=== In popular culture ===\\n\\n\\n==== Literature ====\\nIn Ben Jonson\\'s comedy play, The Poetaster (1601), Julia is the romantic interest of Ovid. The play itself is commonly thought to be a parody on the literary scene at the time with Julia and Ovid performing a balcony scene similar to Romeo and Juliet.\\nAphra Behn\\'s satirical, heroic epistle poem, Ovid to Julia. A Letter (1685). The poem itself is a satire of John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby, who allegedly courted the future Queen Anne and was exiled from court in 1682.\\nCharlotte-Antoinette de Bressay\\'s epistolary novel, Lettres De Julie À Ovide Et D\\'ovide À Julie (\"Letters from Julia, the Daughter of Augustus, to Ovid\", 1753).\\nRobert Graves\\' novel, I, Claudius (1934). The titular character, Claudius, recounts that Julia was tricked by Livia into taking aphrodisiacs that increase her sexual appetite, leading to her affairs and ultimately her exile. Graves appears to have been largely influenced by Macrobius\\' account of Julia, with Claudius referring to her as \"a decent, good hearted woman, though fond of pleasures and excitement, and the only one of my female relations who had a kindly word for me.\"\\nTaylor Caldwell\\'s novel Dear and Glorious Physician (1958) portrays Julia as the unhappy wife of Tiberius and a seductress of Lucanus, the young evangelist Saint Luke.\\nElisabeth Dored\\'s novel, Jeg elsket Tiberius (\"I Loved Tiberius\", 1959), Julia serves as the main character; it portrays Julia as innocent of all charges against her, both her affairs and modern historians’ speculation of a plot.\\nJulia is one of the narrators in John Edward Williams\\' epistolary novel Augustus (1972). There are a number of contributions in her name, written as part of a diary she wrote while in exile in Pandateria reflecting on her father, her marriages, her relationships with her lovers and the restrictions on her as a prominent Roman matron.\\nAllan Massie\\'s novel, Augustus (1986), depicts Julia very closely to the contemporary histories, with her engaging in affairs as a slight against her father\\'s laws. Its follow-up, Tiberius (1991), invents an affair between Julia and Tiberius during her marriage to Marcellus.\\nEdward Burton\\'s novel, Caesar\\'s Daughter (1999). Julia is the titular character; it downplays her affairs with Iullus Antonius being her only lover and instead attributes Julia\\'s exile to a failed coup to kill Tiberius.\\nJulia appears in the final novel in Colleen McCullough\\'s Master of Rome series, Antony and Cleopatra (2007), as a child. Emphasising her as a highly intelligent child, the focus is chiefly on her education, which Octavian purposefully ensures is \"like a man\\'s\".\\nMichelle Moran\\'s novel, Cleopatra\\'s Daughter (2009), which focuses on Cleopatra Selene, Queen Cleopatra VII\\'s daughter, depicts a teenage Julia as one of the main characters.\\n\\n\\n==== Film and television ====\\nIn the 1976 BBC Television adaptation of I, Claudius, Julia was portrayed by Frances White. Julia is one of the few major female characters who does not scheme to murder another character, along with her daughter Agrippina the Elder, her cousin Antonia Minor and Antonia\\'s granddaughter, Helen.\\nIn the Italian mini series, Imperium: Augustus, Julia was portrayed by Vittoria Belvedere. The series focused on the relationship between Augustus and Julia as he recounts how he came to power to her. After being forced into an abusive marriage with Tiberius by her father and Livia, she begins an affair with Iullus Antonius. He subsequently attempts to murder Augustus in order to free Julia from his dynastic plans, leading to her exile.\\nIn the film, The Robe, she is played by Rosalind Ivan, making an anachronistic appearance as Tiberius\\' wife.\\n\\n\\n== Role in Anno Domini chronology ==\\nIn 1605, the Polish historian Laurentius Suslyga published a tract (later quoted by Kepler), which for the first time suggested that Jesus was born sometime during the years 6-4 BC, not on December 25, 1 BC as Dionysius Exiguus implied, but never stated. According to Dionysius\\' dating scheme, the Christian era supposedly began on January 1, AD 1 about one week after Jesus\\' birth at the end of December. Julia\\'s expulsion from Rome in 2 BC was featured in Suslyga\\'s chronological argument which sought to establish Herod\\'s death in 4 BC. Suslyga\\'s chronological ideas concerning the dating of Herod\\'s death based on Julia the Elder\\'s exile have since been challenged by archaeologists.\\n\\n\\n== Marriages and births ==\\n25 BC, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, until his death on September 23 BC. No children.\\n21 BC, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, until his death in 12 BC. Their children:\\nGaius Caesar in 20 BC\\nVipsania Julia Agrippina (known as Julia the Younger) in c. 19 BC.\\nLucius Caesar in 17 BC\\nVipsania Agrippina Julia (known as Agrippina the Elder) in 14 BC (mother of Emperor Caligula)\\nAgrippa Postumus in 12 BC (posthumously after Agrippa\\'s death).\\n11 BC, Julia marries her stepbrother Tiberius.
